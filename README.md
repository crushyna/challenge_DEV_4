Create a system composed of following services: 1. producer 2. message broker 3. multiplier 4. database Producer is a program producing pairs of integers (e.g. [17, 3]) and sending them to a message broker. You are free to choose the message format. Message broker lives in a docker container. Use an of+the+sheld message broker of your choice (e.g. RabbitMQ) Multiplier service consumes pairs of integers from the message queue, multiplies the numbers, and saves both input and result in a database. Database server runs within another docker container. It holds a database with one table: (id, number1:int, number2:int, result:int)
